# Machine Learning Projects via ml-pyproj

Welcome to the `ml-pyproj` repository, a comprehensive collection of Machine Learning enabled processes integrated with DevOps guidelines implemented using `Python` and UI as `Hugo`.

## üí° Categories

1. **ml-pipelines**: Projects focused on ML workflows and DevOps integrations.

## üöÄ Workspace (s)

This repository utilizes two environments: `development` and `production` through `GitHub-Actions` to enssure CI/CD pipelines are in place.

* `development.yml`
* `production.yml`

[![development.yml](https://github.com/sabyasc/ml-pyproj/actions/workflows/development.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sabyasc/ml-pyproj/actions/workflows/development.yml)
[![production.yml](https://github.com/sabyasc/ml-pyproj/actions/workflows/production.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sabyasc/ml-pyproj/actions/workflows/production.yml)

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Quality and Model Tracking

1. This repository uses `CodeQL` via `GitHub-Actions` for code scanning to ensure security and quality.

2. The `ml-pipelines` utilize `mlflow` for tracking and managing experiments, ensuring reproducibility and efficiency.

3. Projects follow SOLID principles for high code quality:
    - **Single Responsibility Principle**
    - **Open-Closed Principle**
    - **Liskov Substitution Principle**
    - **Interface Segregation Principle**
    - **Dependency Inversion Principle**
